<p>Isn't it nice?</p>

  This is a lot of text which means it spans mulitple lines. When text 
  spnas mulitple lines like this, its much easier to read our code if we
  indent the multiple lines of text within our paragraph tags. 
  in other words, we add a p tag, have a line break and indent, and then add our 
  text.
